# AoC2024

Year 1 of properly trying to complete advent of code.
Hopefully can write better c++ code and try to use some modern cpp constructs.

|:----------:|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [1](day1) | Sorting, Hashing          | Day 1: learned about fstream and stringstream and how to better parse cpp strings... |
| [2](day2) | Brute force               | Note: Try to do this functionally                                                    |
| [3](day3) | Regex                     | Learned regex                                                                        |
| [4](day4) | 2D Array, Regex           | Was kind of a fun problem set.                                                       |
| [5](day5) | Hashing, Sorting          | Not everything has to be done with a DAG/Topo sort.                                  |
| [6](day6) | 2D Array, Simulation, Set | Tried pre-optimising and ended up taking more time to come up with a failed solution |
| [7](day7) | Brute force               | Brute force approach to try to solve the problem. Note: try functional approach      |
| [8](day8) | Hashing, Pair-compute     | Learned about type aliasing and to not create struct if not needed. std::pair doesnt have its own hash and structs have even less functions implemented. Need to be careful clearing containers when needed|
| [9](day9) |                           | Part one was quite simple. Can try to do it functionally. Part 2 was a little hard. Need to make sure i interpret the qn right before solving. Code writing needs a lot of cleanup...
| [10](day10) |DP                       |DP Refresher. Took a while to come up with a solution with very funky DS. Can probably be solved using graph more easily for part1|
| [10](day10) |DP                       |DP Refresher. Took a while to come up with a solution with very funky DS. Can probably be solved using graph more easily for part1|

| [13](day13) |Linear Algebra           |Tried to use matrix multiplication but didnt work (later found out i transposed the matrix... Brute forced failed part 2 before fixing matrix solution|
