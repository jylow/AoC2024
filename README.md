# AoC2024

Year 1 of properly trying to complete advent of code.
Hopefully can write better c++ code and try to use some modern cpp constructs.

| [1](day1) | Sorting, Hashing          | Day 1: learned about fstream and stringstream and how to better parse cpp strings... |
| [2](day2) | Brute force               | Note: Try to do this functionally                                                    |
| [3](day3) | Regex                     | Learned regex                                                                        |
| [4](day4) | 2D Array, Regex           | Was kind of a fun problem set.                                                       |
| [5](day5) | Hashing, Sorting          | Not everything has to be done with a DAG/Topo sort.                                  |
| [6](day6) | 2D Array, Simulation, Set | Tried pre-optimising and ended up taking more time to come up with a failed solution |
| [7](day7) | Brute force               | Brute force approach to try to solve the problem. Note: try functional approach      |
